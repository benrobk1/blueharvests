# Progressive Web App (PWA) Setup

Blue Harvests is configured as a Progressive Web App, allowing users to install it on their devices like a native app.

## Features

- **Installable**: Users can install the app on their home screen
- **Offline Support**: Basic functionality works offline
- **Fast Loading**: Cached assets for quick page loads
- **App-like Experience**: Full screen, no browser UI

## Installation

### For Users

Visit `/install` on your device to see installation instructions specific to your platform:

**On iPhone/iPad:**
1. Open the app in Safari
2. Tap the Share button (square with arrow)
3. Scroll down and tap "Add to Home Screen"
4. Tap "Add"

**On Android:**
1. Open the app in Chrome
2. Tap the menu (three dots)
3. Tap "Install app" or "Add to Home screen"
4. Tap "Install"

### For Developers

The PWA configuration is in `vite-pwa.config.ts`. Key settings:

- **Icons**: 192x192 and 512x512 PNG icons in `/public`
- **Manifest**: App name, theme color, display mode
- **Service Worker**: Auto-generated by Vite PWA plugin
- **Caching**: Network-first strategy for API calls, cache-first for assets

## Offline Capabilities

The app caches:
- Static assets (JS, CSS, images)
- API responses (24-hour cache)
- Product listings
- User profile data

Network-first strategy ensures fresh data when online, falls back to cache when offline.

## Testing PWA

1. Build the app: `npm run build`
2. Preview: `npm run preview`
3. Open in browser and check:
   - Install prompt appears
   - Service worker registers
   - Offline mode works
   - Assets cache properly

## Icons

PWA icons are located in `/public`:
- `pwa-192x192.png` - Small icon for Android
- `pwa-512x512.png` - Large icon and splash screen

To update icons, replace these files with your custom icons maintaining the same dimensions.

## Manifest Customization

Edit `vite-pwa.config.ts` to customize:
- App name and description
- Theme and background colors
- Display mode (standalone, fullscreen, minimal-ui)
- Orientation (portrait, landscape)
- Start URL

## Service Worker

The service worker is automatically generated. To customize caching strategies, edit the `workbox` section in `vite-pwa.config.ts`.
